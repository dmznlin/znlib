Welcome to ModLink Visual Component Library!
===========================================================================

Thank you for purchasing the registered edition of ModLink.

ModLink is a set of native VCL components for Borland/CodeGear/Embarcadero
Delphi and C++Builder that offer a sophisticated solution for seamless
integration of Modbus communication protocol into your own Windows
applications.

With ModLink, you can easily turn any Windows application into either
Modbus client that initiates network transactions in order to request a
remote Modbus server to perform a specific action, or Modbus server that
listens for incoming requests from a remote Modbus client and performs an
appropriate action.

For details on installing and using ModLink, please refer to the
accompanying help file - Help\ModLink.chm.
