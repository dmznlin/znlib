This example shows how to convert XML data into a record structure.

It is taken from a "real-life" demo for one of our customers.

The code reads in the XML file, finds a list of elements that must be turned
into a dynamic array, then reads each element in the array and converts the
XML structure into a "flat" record structure.

It shows how to use "AttributeByName", "ReadString" and "NodesByName".

The record structure is then listed in a listview.
