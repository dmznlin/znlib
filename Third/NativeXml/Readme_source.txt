About NativeXml.pas
========================

This is a small-footprint native Delphi implementation to read and write
XML documents. It provides a fully object-oriented approach to working
with XML files, with clearly defined and Delphi-focused properties,
events and methods.

You can use this code to read and write XML documents from/to files, streams
or strings. The load routine generates events that can be used to display
load progress on the fly.
